## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application uses a decoupled frontend-backend architecture:

1.  **Frontend (Vanilla JS):** A single-page application that handles all user interaction. It performs client-side audio conversion to PCM using the Web Audio API, manages the UI, and communicates with the backend via a single WebSocket connection.
2.  **Backend (Python/FastAPI):** An asynchronous API server that orchestrates the entire AI pipeline. It receives the PCM audio stream from the client and manages the real-time, bidirectional communication with all external AI services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, WebSockets
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Web Audio API)
* **Python Libraries:** `google-generativeai`, `assemblyai`, `websockets`, `requests`
* **Services:** Murf AI, AssemblyAI, Google Gemini, Alpha Vantage (Stocks), ExchangeRate-API (Currency)
